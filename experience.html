  <p style="line-height:2.0; font-size: 18px; "> One of the most memorable experiences of my life occurred when I was lucky enough to attend a GOT7 fanmeeting. GOT7 made their first visit to Malaysia for a fanmeeting in Kuala Lumpur on 20<sup>th</sup> March 2015. Erama Creative arranged for the lads to hold a press conference where they met with members of the media. I was able to go to a GOT7 fanmeeting in Malaysia thanks to an invitation from my cousin, who won a contest for two tickets on Facebook and invited me along. When we arrived, I was blown away by the crowd and the ambiance. Everyone was so friendly and it was so cute to see all the fangirls and boys. We purchased a t-shirt prior to entering the venue, and there were fan projects taking place. Before entering the venue, I was given this banner by the employees. They began the fanmeeting with energetic performances of their hit songs 'Stop Stop It' and 'Gimme.' It is incredible because it appears much more remarkable in person and their live vocals are so flawless. Next, audiences were treated to versions of 'Moonlight' and 'Forever Young'. One of my favourite parts was at the beginning when GOT7s song was playing in the background and everyone began singing the fanchant. Then, they had a lot of fun with us during special events and activities. In honour of Malaysian culture, the group members did a traditional Malay dance. Some lucky fans were then able to come on stage and have a photo session with the boys. Love letters written by fans were pulled from a box and read a loud by the group members. They also played a special VCR for the group, and even prepared a birthday cake to celebrate Jacksonâ€™s birthday in advance. It was a night I will never forget! </p>
